== Overview
* Tests use the RestAssured DSL to send and validate rest requests to the VDI service.
* JUnit is used as the testing framework to manage test execution.

== Adding a test
In order to add a test, you can add an entry to the `tests.yaml` file in the `resources/testdata` directory:

[source]
----
- path: isasimple/diy-example.csv
  project: PlasmoDB
  expectation: failed_install
  type: isasimple
----

The path should specify a file path relative to the testdata directory.

The following environment variables must be set to run the integration tests:

1. `VDI_BASE_URL` -- URL of VDI service to run tests against
2. `AUTH_TOKEN` -- Auth token of user to run the tests as
